Many a morning hath he there beene seene,\\r\\nWith teares augmenting the fresh mornings deaw,\\r\\nAdding to cloudes, more cloudes with his deepe sighes,\\r\\nBut all so soone as the all-cheering Sunne,\\r\\nShould in the farthest East begin to draw\\r\\nThe shadie Curtaines from Auroras bed,\\r\\nAway from light steales home my heauy Sonne,\\r\\nAnd priuate in his Chamber pennes himselfe,\\r\\nShuts vp his windowes, lockes faire day-light out,\\r\\nAnd makes himselfe an artificiall night:\\r\\nBlacke and portendous must this humour proue,\\r\\nVnlesse good counsell may the cause remoue\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben.

Not hauing that, which hauing, makes them short\\r\\n  Ben. In loue\\r\\n\\r\\n   Romeo. Out\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben. Of loue\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rom. Out of her fauour where I am in loue\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben. Alas that loue so gentle in his view,\\r\\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proofe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rom. Alas that loue, whose view is muffled still,\\r\\nShould without eyes, see path-wayes to his will:\\r\\nWhere shall we dine? O me: what fray was heere?\\r\\nYet tell me not, for I haue heard it all:\\r\\nHeere's much to do with hate, but more with loue:\\r\\nWhy then, O brawling loue, O louing hate,\\r\\nO any thing, of nothing first created:\\r\\nO heauie lightnesse, serious vanity,\\r\\nMishapen Chaos of welseeming formes,\\r\\nFeather of lead, bright smoake, cold fire, sicke health,\\r\\nStill waking sleepe, that is not what it is:\\r\\nThis loue feele I, that feele no loue in this.\\r\\nDoest thou not laugh?\\r\\n  Ben. No Coze, I rather weepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rom. Good heart, at what?\\r\\n  Ben. At thy good hearts oppression\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rom. Why such is loues transgression.\\r\\nGriefes of mine owne lie heauie in my breast,\\r\\nWhich thou wilt propagate to haue it preast\\r\\nWith more of thine, this loue that thou hast showne,\\r\\nDoth adde more griefe, to too much of mine owne.\\r\\nLoue, is a smoake made with the fume of sighes,\\r\\nBeing purg'd, a fire sparkling in Louers eyes,\\r\\nBeing vext, a Sea nourisht with louing teares,\\r\\nWhat is it else? a madnesse, most discreet,\\r\\nA choking gall, and a preseruing sweet:\\r\\nFarewell my Coze\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben. Soft I will goe along.\\r\\nAnd if you leaue me so, you do me wrong\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rom. Tut I haue lost my selfe, I am not here,\\r\\nThis is not Romeo, hee's some other where\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben. Tell me in sadnesse, who is that you loue?\\r\\n  Rom. What shall I grone and tell thee?\\r\\n  Ben. Grone, why no: but sadly tell me who\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rom. A sicke man in sadnesse makes his will:\\r\\nA word ill vrg'd to one that is so ill:\\r\\nIn sadnesse Cozin, I do loue a woman\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben. I aym'd so neare, when I suppos'd you lou'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rom. A right good marke man, and shee's faire I loue\\r\\n  Ben. A right faire marke, faire Coze, is soonest hit\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rom. Well in that hit you misse, sheel not be hit\\r\\nWith Cupids arrow, she hath Dians wit:\\r\\nAnd in strong proofe of chastity well arm'd:\\r\\nFrom loues weake childish Bow, she liues vncharm'd.\\r\\nShee will not stay the siege of louing tearmes,\\r\\nNor bid th' encounter of assailing eyes.\\r\\nNor open her lap to Sainct-seducing Gold:\\r\\nO she is rich in beautie, onely poore,\\r\\nThat when she dies, with beautie dies her store\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben. Then she hath sworne, that she will still liue chast?\\r\\n  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing make huge wast?\\r\\nFor beauty steru'd with her seuerity,\\r\\nCuts beauty off from all posteritie.\\r\\nShe is too faire, too wise: wisely too faire,\\r\\nTo merit blisse by making me dispaire:\\r\\nShe hath forsworne to loue, and in that vow\\r\\nDo I liue dead, that liue to tell it now\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben. Be rul'd by me, forget to thinke of her\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rom. O teach me how I should forget to thinke\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben. By giuing liberty vnto thine eyes,\\r\\nExamine other beauties,\\r\\n  Ro. 'Tis the way to cal hers (exquisit) in question more,\\r\\nThese happy maskes that kisse faire Ladies browes,\\r\\nBeing blacke, puts vs in mind they hide the faire:\\r\\nHe that is strooken blind, cannot forget\\r\\nThe precious treasure of his eye-sight lost:\\r\\nShew me a Mistresse that is passing faire,\\r\\nWhat doth her beauty serue but as a note,\\r\\nWhere I may read who past that passing faire.\\r\\nFarewell thou can'st not teach me to forget,\\r\\n  Ben. Ile pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Capulet, Countie Paris, and the Clowne.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Capu. Mountague is bound as well as I,\\r\\nIn penalty alike, and 'tis not hard I thinke,\\r\\nFor men so old as wee, to keepe the peace\\r\\n\\r\\n   Par. Of Honourable reckoning are you both,\\r\\nAnd pittie 'tis you liu'd at ods so long:\\r\\nBut now my Lord, what say you to my sute?\\r\\n  Capu. But saying ore what I haue said before,\\r\\nMy Child is yet a stranger in the world,\\r\\nShee hath not seene the change of fourteene yeares,\\r\\nLet two more Summers wither in their pride,\\r\\nEre we may thinke her ripe to be a Bride\\r\\n\\r\\n   Pari. Younger then she, are happy mothers made\\r\\n\\r\\n   Capu. And too soone mar'd are those so early made:\\r\\nEarth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,\\r\\nShee's the hopefull Lady of my earth:\\r\\nBut wooe her gentle Paris, get her heart,\\r\\nMy will to her consent, is but a part,\\r\\nAnd shee agree, within her scope of choise,\\r\\nLyes my consent, and faire according voice:\\r\\nThis night I hold an old accustom'd Feast,\\r\\nWhereto I haue inuited many a Guest,\\r\\nSuch as I loue, and you among the store,\\r\\nOne more, most welcome makes my number more:\\r\\nAt my poore house, looke to behold this night,\\r\\nEarth-treading starres, that make darke heauen light,\\r\\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feele,\\r\\nWhen well apparrel'd Aprill on the heele\\r\\nOf limping Winter treads, euen such delight\\r\\nAmong fresh Fennell buds shall you this night\\r\\nInherit at my house: heare all, all see:\\r\\nAnd like her most, whose merit most shall be:\\r\\nWhich one more veiw, of many, mine being one,\\r\\nMay stand in number, though in reckning none.\\r\\nCome, goe with me: goe sirrah trudge about,\\r\\nThrough faire Verona, find those persons out,\\r\\nWhose names are written there, and to them say,\\r\\nMy house and welcome, on their pleasure stay.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ser.

Heere it\\r\\nis written, that the Shoo-maker should meddle with his\\r\\nYard, and the Tayler with his Last, the Fisher with his\\r\\nPensill, and the Painter with his Nets. But I am sent to\\r\\nfind those persons whose names are writ, & can neuer find\\r\\nwhat names the writing person hath here writ (I must to\\r\\nthe learned) in good time.\\r\\nEnter Benuolio, and Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Tut man, one fire burnes out anothers burning,\\r\\nOne paine is lesned by anothers anguish:\\r\\nTurne giddie, and be holpe by backward turning:\\r\\nOne desparate greefe, cures with anothers languish:\\r\\nTake thou some new infection to the eye,\\r\\nAnd the rank poyson of the old wil die\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rom. Your Plantan leafe is excellent for that\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben. For what I pray thee?\\r\\n  Rom. For your broken shin\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben. Why Romeo art thou mad?\\r\\n  Rom.

A fortnight and odde dayes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Nurse. Euen or odde, of all daies in the yeare come\\r\\nLammas Eue at night shall she be fourteene. Susan & she,\\r\\nGod rest all Christian soules, were of an age. Well Susan\\r\\nis with God, she was too good for me. But as I said, on Lamas\\r\\nEue at night shall she be fourteene, that shall she marie,\\r\\nI remember it well. 'Tis since the Earth-quake now\\r\\neleuen yeares, and she was wean'd I neuer shall forget it,\\r\\nof all the daies of the yeare, vpon that day: for I had then\\r\\nlaid Worme-wood to my Dug sitting in the Sunne vnder\\r\\nthe Douehouse wall, my Lord and you were then at\\r\\nMantua, nay I doe beare a braine. But as I said, when it\\r\\ndid tast the Worme-wood on the nipple of my Dugge,\\r\\nand felt it bitter, pretty foole, to see it teachie, and fall out\\r\\nwith the Dugge, Shake quoth the Doue-house, 'twas no\\r\\nneede I trow to bid mee trudge, and since that time it is\\r\\na eleuen yeares, for then she could stand alone, nay bi'th'\\r\\nroode she could haue runne, & wadled all about: for euen\\r\\nthe day before she broke her brow, & then my Husband\\r\\nGod be with his soule, a was a merrie man, tooke vp the\\r\\nChild, yea quoth hee, doest thou fall vpon thy face? thou\\r\\nwilt fall backeward when thou hast more wit, wilt thou\\r\\nnot Iule? And by my holy-dam, the pretty wretch lefte\\r\\ncrying, & said I: to see now how a Iest shall come about.\\r\\nI warrant, & I shall liue a thousand yeares, I neuer should\\r\\nforget it: wilt thou not Iule quoth he? and pretty foole it\\r\\nstinted, and said I\\r\\n\\r\\n   Old La. Inough of this, I pray thee hold thy peace\\r\\n\\r\\n   Nurse. Yes Madam, yet I cannot chuse but laugh, to\\r\\nthinke it should leaue crying, & say I: and yet I warrant\\r\\nit had vpon it brow, a bumpe as big as a young Cockrels\\r\\nstone? A perilous knock, and it cryed bitterly. Yea quoth\\r\\nmy husband, fall'st vpon thy face, thou wilt fall backward\\r\\nwhen thou commest to age: wilt thou not Iule? It\\r\\nstinted: and said I\\r\\n\\r\\n   Iule. And stint thou too, I pray thee Nurse, say I\\r\\n\\r\\n   Nur. Peace I haue done: God marke thee too his grace\\r\\nthou wast the prettiest Babe that ere I nurst, and I might\\r\\nliue to see thee married once, I haue my wish\\r\\n\\r\\n   Old La. Marry that marry is the very theame\\r\\nI came to talke of, tell me daughter Iuliet,\\r\\nHow stands your disposition to be Married?\\r\\n  Iuli. It is an houre that I dreame not of\\r\\n\\r\\n   Nur. An houre, were I not thine onely Nurse, I would\\r\\nsay thou had'st suckt wisedome from thy teat\\r\\n\\r\\n   Old La. Well thinke of marriage now, yonger then you\\r\\nHeere in Verona, Ladies of esteeme,\\r\\nAre made already Mothers. By my count\\r\\nI was your Mother, much vpon these yeares\\r\\nThat you are now a Maide, thus then in briefe:\\r\\nThe valiant Paris seekes you for his loue\\r\\n\\r\\n   Nurse.

Her Chariot is an emptie\\r\\nHaselnut, made by the Ioyner Squirrel or old Grub, time\\r\\nout a mind, the Faries Coach-makers: & in this state she\\r\\ngallops night by night, through Louers braines: and then\\r\\nthey dreame of Loue. On Courtiers knees, that dreame on\\r\\nCursies strait: ore Lawyers fingers, who strait dreampt on\\r\\nFees, ore Ladies lips, who strait on kisses dreame, which\\r\\noft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, because their\\r\\nbreath with Sweet meats tainted are. Sometime she gallops\\r\\nore a Courtiers nose, & then dreames he of smelling\\r\\nout a sute: & somtime comes she with Tith pigs tale, tickling\\r\\na Parsons nose as a lies asleepe, then he dreames of\\r\\nanother Benefice. Sometime she driueth ore a Souldiers\\r\\nnecke, & then dreames he of cutting Forraine throats, of\\r\\nBreaches, Ambuscados, Spanish Blades: Of Healths fiue\\r\\nFadome deepe, and then anon drums in his eares, at which\\r\\nhe startes and wakes; and being thus frighted, sweares a\\r\\nprayer or two & sleepes againe: this is that very Mab that\\r\\nplats the manes of Horses in the night: & bakes the Elklocks\\r\\nin foule sluttish haires, which once vntangled, much\\r\\nmisfortune bodes,\\r\\nThis is the hag, when Maides lie on their backs,\\r\\nThat presses them, and learnes them first to beare,\\r\\nMaking them women of good carriage:\\r\\nThis is she\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio peace,\\r\\nThou talk'st of nothing\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mer. True, I talke of dreames:\\r\\nWhich are the children of an idle braine,\\r\\nBegot of nothing, but vaine phantasie,\\r\\nWhich is as thin of substance as the ayre,\\r\\nAnd more inconstant then the wind, who wooes\\r\\nEuen now the frozen bosome of the North:\\r\\nAnd being anger'd, puffes away from thence,\\r\\nTurning his side to the dew dropping South\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben. This wind you talke of blowes vs from our selues,\\r\\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rom. I feare too early, for my mind misgiues,\\r\\nSome consequence yet hanging in the starres,\\r\\nShall bitterly begin his fearefull date\\r\\nWith this nights reuels, and expire the tearme\\r\\nOf a despised life clos'd in my brest:\\r\\nBy some vile forfeit of vntimely death.\\r\\nBut he that hath the stirrage of my course,\\r\\nDirect my sute: on lustie Gentlemen\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ben.

If I prophane with my vnworthiest hand,\\r\\nThis holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,\\r\\nMy lips to blushing Pilgrims did ready stand,\\r\\nTo smooth that rough touch, with a tender kisse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Iul.

What man art thou, that thus bescreen'd in night\\r\\nSo stumblest on my counsell?\\r\\n  Rom. By a name,\\r\\nI know not how to tell thee who I am:\\r\\nMy name deare Saint, is hatefull to my selfe,\\r\\nBecause it is an Enemy to thee,\\r\\nHad I it written, I would teare the word\\r\\n\\r\\n   Iuli. My eares haue yet not drunke a hundred words\\r\\nOf thy tongues vttering, yet I know the sound.\\r\\nArt thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\\r\\n  Rom.

Did'st\\r\\nthou not fall out with a Tailor for wearing his new Doublet\\r\\nbefore Easter? with another, for tying his new shooes\\r\\nwith old Riband, and yet thou wilt Tutor me from quarrelling?\\r\\n  Ben.

You say you do not know the Ladies mind?\\r\\nVneuen is the course, I like it not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Pa. Immoderately she weepes for Tybalts death,\\r\\nAnd therfore haue I little talke of Loue,\\r\\nFor Venus smiles not in a house of teares.\\r\\nNow sir, her Father counts it dangerous\\r\\nThat she doth giue her sorrow so much sway:\\r\\nAnd in his wisedome, hasts our marriage,\\r\\nTo stop the inundation of her teares,\\r\\nWhich too much minded by her selfe alone,\\r\\nMay be put from her by societie.\\r\\nNow doe you know the reason of this hast?\\r\\n  Fri.

Come Mountague, for thou art early vp\\r\\nTo see thy Sonne and Heire, now early downe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Moun.

Then say at once, what thou dost know in this?\\r\\n  Fri. I will be briefe, for my short date of breath\\r\\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\\r\\nRomeo there dead, was husband to that Iuliet,\\r\\nAnd she there dead, that's Romeos faithfull wife:\\r\\nI married them; and their stolne marriage day\\r\\nWas Tybalts Doomesday: whose vntimely death\\r\\nBanish'd the new-made Bridegroome from this Citie:\\r\\nFor whom (and not for Tybalt) Iuliet pinde.\\r\\nYou, to remoue that siege of Greefe from her,\\r\\nBetroth'd, and would haue married her perforce\\r\\nTo Countie Paris. Then comes she to me,\\r\\nAnd (with wilde lookes) bid me deuise some meanes\\r\\nTo rid her from this second Marriage,\\r\\nOr in my Cell there would she kill her selfe.\\r\\nThen gaue I her (so Tutor'd by my Art)\\r\\nA sleeping Potion, which so tooke effect\\r\\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\\r\\nThe forme of death. Meane time, I writ to Romeo,\\r\\nThat he should hither come, as this dyre night,\\r\\nTo helpe to take her from her borrowed graue,\\r\\nBeing the time the Potions force should cease.\\r\\nBut he which bore my Letter, Frier Iohn,\\r\\nWas stay'd by accident; and yesternight\\r\\nReturn'd my Letter backe. Then all alone,\\r\\nAt the prefixed houre of her waking,\\r\\nCame I to take her from her Kindreds vault,\\r\\nMeaning to keepe her closely at my Cell,\\r\\nTill I conueniently could send to Romeo.\\r\\nBut when I came (some Minute ere the time\\r\\nOf her awaking) heere vntimely lay\\r\\nThe Noble Paris, and true Romeo dead.\\r\\nShee wakes, and I intreated her come foorth,\\r\\nAnd beare this worke of Heauen, with patience:\\r\\nBut then, a noyse did scarre me from the Tombe,\\r\\nAnd she (too desperate) would not go with me,\\r\\nBut (as it seemes) did violence on her selfe.\\r\\nAll this I know, and to the Marriage her Nurse is priuy:\\r\\nAnd if ought in this miscarried by my fault,\\r\\nLet my old life be sacrific'd, some houre before the time,\\r\\nVnto the rigour of seuerest Law\\r\\n\\r\\n   Prin. We still haue knowne thee for a Holy man.\\r\\nWhere's Romeo's man? What can he say to this?\\r\\n  Boy. I brought my Master newes of Iuliets death,\\r\\nAnd then in poste he came from Mantua\\r\\nTo this same place, to this same Monument.\\r\\nThis Letter he early bid me giue his Father,\\r\\nAnd threatned me with death, going in the Vault,\\r\\nIf I departed not, and left him there\\r\\n\\r\\n   Prin. Giue me the Letter, I will look on it.\\r\\nWhere is the Counties Page that rais'd the Watch?\\r\\nSirra, what made your Master in this place?\\r\\n  Page. He came with flowres to strew his Ladies graue,\\r\\nAnd bid me stand aloofe, and so I did:\\r\\nAnon comes one with light to ope the Tombe,\\r\\nAnd by and by my Maister drew on him,\\r\\nAnd then I ran away to call the Watch\\r\\n\\r\\n   Prin. This Letter doth make good the Friers words,\\r\\nTheir course of Loue, the tydings of her death:\\r\\nAnd heere he writes, that he did buy a poyson\\r\\nOf a poore Pothecarie, and therewithall\\r\\nCame to this Vault to dye, and lye with Iuliet.\\r\\nWhere be these Enemies? Capulet, Mountague,\\r\\nSee what a scourge is laide vpon your hate,\\r\\nThat Heauen finds meanes to kill your ioyes with Loue;\\r\\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\\r\\nHaue lost a brace of Kinsmen: All are punish'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Cap. O Brother Mountague, giue me thy hand,\\r\\nThis is my Daughters ioynture, for no more\\r\\nCan I demand\\r\\n\\r\\n   Moun. But I can giue thee more:\\r\\nFor I will raise her Statue in pure Gold,\\r\\nThat whiles Verona by that name is knowne,\\r\\nThere shall no figure at that Rate be set,\\r\\nAs that of True and Faithfull Iuliet\\r\\n\\r\\n   Cap. As rich shall Romeo by his Lady ly,\\r\\nPoore sacrifices of our enmity\\r\\n\\r\\n   Prin. A glooming peace this morning with it brings,\\r\\nThe Sunne for sorrow will not shew his head;\\r\\nGo hence, to haue more talke of these sad things,\\r\\nSome shall be pardon'd, and some punished.\\r\\nFor neuer was a Storie of more Wo,\\r\\nThen this of Iuliet, and her Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt. omnes\\r\\n\\r\\nFINIS.\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 1112 ***\\r\\n\""
